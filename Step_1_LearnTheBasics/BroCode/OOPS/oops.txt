<-- OOP Related Concepts -->

1. Class
A class is a user-defined data type that groups attributes (data members) and methods (member functions) together.
It acts as a blueprint for creating objects.

2. Object
An object is an instance of a class.
It represents a real-world entity and occupies memory.

3. Constructor
A constructor is a special member function of a class that is automatically called when an object is created.
It is mainly used to initialize attributes.
• Same name as the class
• No return type

4. Destructor
A destructor is a special member function that is automatically called when an object is destroyed.
It is used to release resources.
• Name starts with ~
• No return type

5. Data Members (Attributes)
Data members, also called attributes, are variables defined inside a class that store the state or properties of an object.

6. Member Functions (Methods)
Member functions, also called methods, are functions defined inside a class that define the behavior or actions of an object.

7. Access Specifiers
Access specifiers define the accessibility of class members:
• public → accessible from anywhere
• private → accessible only within the class
• protected → accessible within the class and derived classes

8. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the concept of binding attributes and methods together within a class and hiding internal details using access specifiers.

9. Abstraction
Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only essential features to the user.
It helps reduce complexity and improve maintainability.

10. Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class to acquire the attributes and methods of another class.
It promotes code reuse and hierarchical classification.

11. Polymorphism
Polymorphism means one method name, many forms.
It allows the same method to behave differently depending on the situation or object.


<-- Connection between Classes, Attributes, Methods, Objects -->

1. Class
A class is a blueprint.
It defines:
• Attributes (what an object has)
• Methods (what an object can do)

2. Attributes
Attributes are variables inside a class.
They store data for an object.

3. Methods
Methods are functions inside a class.
They operate on the attributes.

4. Object
An object is a real instance of a class.
When an object is created:
• It gets its own copy of attributes
• It can call the methods of the class

-------------------------------------
| Class                             |
|  ├── Attributes (data)            |
|  └── Methods (behavior)           |
|         ↓                         |
|       Object                      |
|    (uses attributes + methods)    |
-------------------------------------

# One-line relationship
    • Class → defines attributes and methods
    • Object → uses them
    • Attributes → describe the object
    • Methods → act on the attributes

# Tiny real-life example
    • Class: Car
    • Attributes: color, speed
    • Methods: drive(), brake()
    • Object: myCar
