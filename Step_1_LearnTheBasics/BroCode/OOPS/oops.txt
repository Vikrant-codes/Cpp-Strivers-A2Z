<-- OOP related concepts -->

1. Class
A class is a user-defined data type that groups data members (variables) and member functions (functions) together.
It acts as a blueprint for creating objects.

2. Object
An object is an instance of a class.
It represents a real entity and occupies memory.

3. Constructor
A constructor is a special member function of a class that is automatically called when an object is created.
It is mainly used to initialize data members.
• Same name as the class
• No return type

4. Destructor
A destructor is a special member function that is automatically called when an object is destroyed.
It is used to release resources.
• Name starts with ~
• No return type

5. Data Members
Data members are variables defined inside a class that store the state of an object.

6. Member Functions
Member functions are functions defined inside a class that describe the behavior of an object.

7. Access Specifiers
They define who can access class members:
• public → accessible from anywhere
• private → accessible only inside the class
• protected → accessible in the class and derived classes

8. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the concept of binding data and functions together and hiding internal details using access specifiers.

9. Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class to acquire properties and behavior of another class, promoting code reuse.

10. Polymorphism
Polymorphism means one function name, many forms—the same function behaves differently in different situations.



<-- Connection between Classes, Attributes, Methods, Objects -->

1. Class
A class is a blueprint.
It defines:
• Attributes (what an object has)
• Methods (what an object can do)

2. Attributes
Attributes are variables inside a class.
They store data for an object.

3. Methods
Methods are functions inside a class.
They operate on the attributes.

4. Object
An object is a real instance of a class.
When an object is created:
• It gets its own copy of attributes
• It can call the methods of the class

→ How they are connected (flow)
-------------------------------------
| Class                             |
|  ├── Attributes (data)            |
|  └── Methods (behavior)           |
|         ↓                         |
|       Object                      |
|    (uses attributes + methods)    |
-------------------------------------

# One-line relationship
    • Class → defines attributes and methods
    • Object → uses them
    • Attributes → describe the object
    • Methods → act on the attributes

# Tiny real-life example
    • Class: Car
    • Attributes: color, speed
    • Methods: drive(), brake()
    • Object: myCar
