Leetcode - 162. Find Peak Element -- Medium

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. 
If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater 
than a neighbor that is outside the array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Examples :- 
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1] __ Output: 2
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4] __ Output: 1 or 5

Constraints :- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000 __ -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1 __ nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.

            return i;
