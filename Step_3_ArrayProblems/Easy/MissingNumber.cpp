                                                        Missing Number
Given an array arr containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Example 1:  Input: arr = [3,0,1]       Output: 2
Explanation: n = size = 3, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in arr.
Example 2:  Input: arr = [0,1]         Output: 2
Explanation: n = size = 2 , so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in arr.

        if(freq[i] == 0) 
            return i;
    return -1;     // this return statement is never executed but is added to remove warning because without it the return would've been inside a 
    // conditional statement and compiler consider that the statment might never be true and raises warning

/*
Approach 1 :-
The sum of the first n natural numbers is given by the formula n*(n+1)/2. Since array contains elements in range [0,n] and has a missing number 
than the actual sum of the array would be x less than the expected sum (since x is missing). So we can find x by expected_sum - actual_sum.

Approach 2 :-
We can use XOR to find the missing number. The XOR of a number with itself is 0 and the XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
So if we XOR all the numbers from 0 to n and also XOR all the elements of the array, the result will be the missing number.
ex - consider the array [0,1,4,3] and the missing number is 2 since range is [0,4].
XOR of all numbers from 0 to 4 = 0^1^2^3^4 = 4
XOR of all elements of the array = 0^1^4^3 = 6
So the final XOR will be 4^6 = 2 which is the missing number.
This can be shown as (0^1^2^3^4) ^ (0^1^4^3) = (0^0) ^ (1^1) ^ (2) ^ (3^3) ^ (4^4) = 0 ^ 0 ^ 2 ^ 0 ^ 0 .... since xor of a no. with itself is zero
thus (0^1^2^3^4) ^ (0^1^4^3) = 0 ^ 0 ^ 2 ^ 0 ^ 0 = 2 ... since xor of zero with any number is that number itself
