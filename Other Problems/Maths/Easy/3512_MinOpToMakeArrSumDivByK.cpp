Leetcode - 3512. Minimum Operations to Make Array Sum Divisible by K : Easy

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. You can perform the following operation any number of times:
Select an index i and replace nums[i] with nums[i] - 1.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the array divisible by k.

Examples :-

Input: nums = [3,9,7], k = 5 __ Output: 4
Explanation:
Perform 4 operations on nums[1] = 9. Now, nums = [3, 5, 7].
The sum is 15, which is divisible by 5.

Input: nums = [4,1,3], k = 4 __ Output: 0
Explanation:
The sum is 8, which is already divisible by 4. Hence, no operations are needed.

Input: nums = [3,2], k = 6 __ Output: 5
Explanation:
Perform 3 operations on nums[0] = 3 and 2 operations on nums[1] = 2. Now, nums = [0, 0].
The sum is 0, which is divisible by 6.

Constraints :-
- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
- 1 <= k <= 100

✅ Intuition
We want to make the total sum divisible by k, such that sum % k = 0. 
Initially, if sum is not divisible by k, we can decrement an element and perform this operation until sum becomes divisble.
Let, sum % k = r, means 'r' is the remainder when sum is divided by k. 
To make the sum divisible by k, we need to decrement 'r' from the total sum.
Since in one operation we can decrement 1, to decrement 'r' from total sum, we need to perform 'r' operations.
So, no. of operations = r, which is sum % k.
